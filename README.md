1. How to use the program:
 Start with input the disks number from 1 to 8.  
If you put the wrong input, you cannot start the game and you will see the error message box.  
Then you need to put another number of disks.  
If you put the right disks number, press the start button.  
You will see activated direction buttons which is possible.  
If you want to pause the game, or to check the game time, press the stop button.  
If you want to close the window, press close button.  
If you want to start the game from beginning, press reset button.  
The required movements will show the minimum number of movements to solve the game.  
The movements will show you how many times you move the disks.  
Game history will show you what kind of moving direction you've already done.  
When game is complete, you will see the messagebox and timer will stop automatically.  
From completed game, you only can close the window or reset the game.  

2. Rules of the Game:  
We have three pegs and 1-8 disks.  
The objective of the hanoi tower game is to move the entire stack from peg A (source) to peg C (target).  
Moving disks should follow the following rules:  
-  Only one disk can be moved at a time.  
- A disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.  
- No disk may be placed on top of smaller disk.  

3. Extra features:  
- Each peg has its own color, and the color of disks changes, when they are moved from a disk to another.  

- The time used in the game is counted. For this extra feature, you have two choices, one of which will be evaluated:  
The time used is shown to the user at the end of the game.  

- After the game ends, it is possible to start the game again from the beginning without starting the program again.  

- The game history, i.e. the moves made, is shown for the user.  

- The number of moves made is displayed for the user, as well as how far this number is from the minimal number of moves. (The minimal number of moves is 2^n - 1, where n is the number of disks and 2^n means 2 raised to the power of n.)  

- Extra extra feature for the animation feature: The source, target, and auxiliary pegs are distinguished from each other, when the game always ends with all the disks in the predefined target peg. (To achieve the desired result, the game should be started in a different way, depending on the number of disks is even or odd.) In this case, you can mark the pegs, e.g. with different colors.
